# DevOps-argue

In traditional functionally separated organizations there is rarely cross-departmental integration of these functions with IT operations. DevOps promotes a set of processes and methods for thinking about communication and collaboration between development, QA, and IT operations.

DevOps Summary points:

*Infrastructure as code

*Shared visibility into systems

*Automated deployment

DevOps is about a shift in company culture. It is about development and operations teams working closely. It is about removing organizational silos that slow down deployments and affect your customers, both internal and external. It doesn't mean cutting corners in procedures, but it does mean being efficient in your communication. It means understanding that building and deploying complex applications is a collaborative effort, and no team works in a vacuum.

DevOps is fundamentally about full stack visibility and treating the whole project lifecycle as "in scope" of the product.

In a DevOps shop, the dev team and the ops team both know how to develop and deploy on servers. They understand the dependencies, the code and the processes. In essence treating those processes as yet more code (CM, automated provisioning, etc.) So a dev or ops can push changes through quickly and repeatably.  Ultimately, the disparate team ends up really just being one team with a wide range of skills.

Containerisation and virtualization are the focus.  Instead of a delivery pipeline producing executables or libraries that need to be configured and have dependencies, DevOps approaches produce virtual machines or Docker images, that are fully tested and self-contained, and that can be deployed to infrastructure in a consistent way.

Because DevOps is a cultural shift and collaboration between development, operations and testing, there is no single DevOps tool, rather a set or “DevOps toolchain” consisting of multiple tools. Generally, DevOps tools fit into one or more of these categories, which is reflective of the software development and delivery process:

Code – Code development and review, continuous integration tools

Build – Version control tools, code merging, build status

Test – Test and results determine performance

Package – Artifact repository, application pre-deployment staging

Release – Change management, release approvals, release automation

Configure – Infrastructure configuration and management, Infrastructure as Code tools

Monitor – Applications performance monitoring, end user experience

Tools such as Docker (containerization); Jenkins (continuous Integration); Ansible (Infrastructure as Code); Vagrant (virtualization tool); Mesos/DCOS (Cluster Orchestration); Kubernetes/Openshift & Cloud Foundry (Docker PaaS's) among many others.

Adoption of DevOps is being driven by many factors including:

Use of agile and other development processes and methods
Demand for an increased rate of production releases from application and business unit stakeholders
Wide availability of virtualized and cloud infrastructure from internal and external providers
Increased usage of data center automation and configuration management tools
Increased focus on test automation and continuous integration methods
A critical mass of publicly available best practices

Companies that practice DevOps have reported significant benefits, including significantly shorter time-to-market, improved customer satisfaction, better product quality, more reliable releases, improved productivity and efficiency, and the increased ability to build the right product by fast experimentation.
