DevOps is about a shift in company culture. It is about development and operations teams working closely. It is about removing organizational silos that slow down deployments and affect your customers, both internal and external. It doesn't mean cutting corners in procedures, but it does mean being efficient in your communication. It means understanding that building and deploying complex applications is a collaborative effort, and no team works in a vacuum.

DevOps is fundamentally about full stack visibility and treating the whole project lifecycle as "in scope" of the product.

In a DevOps shop, the dev team and the ops team both know how to develop and deploy on servers. They understand the dependencies, the code and the processes. In essence treating those processes as yet more code (CM, automated provisioning, etc.)

So a dev or ops can push changes through quickly and repeatably. And, ultimately, the disparate team ends up really just being one team with a wide range of skills.
